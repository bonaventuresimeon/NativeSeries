feat: Enhance deployment automation with Helm and ArgoCD integration

## ðŸš€ Major Enhancements

### Infrastructure Improvements
- Add comprehensive Helm chart validation and linting
- Implement ArgoCD application deployment automation
- Enhance Docker image building and pushing capabilities
- Create robust deployment scripts with error handling

### Tool Installation & Testing
- Install and test Helm v3.18.4 âœ…
- Install and test ArgoCD CLI v3.0.12 âœ…
- Install and test kubectl v1.33.3 âœ…
- Provide Docker installation script and testing

### Validation Results
- Python code validation: âœ… PASSED
- Basic tests: âœ… 3/3 tests passed
- Helm chart validation: âœ… PASSED
- ArgoCD application validation: âœ… PASSED
- Dockerfile validation: âœ… PASSED
- requirements.txt validation: âœ… PASSED

### Deployment Options
1. Validate Configuration Only - Perfect for CI/CD validation
2. Build Docker Image Locally - For local development
3. Deploy to Production with Docker Hub - Production deployment
4. Install ArgoCD and Deploy Application - Full Kubernetes deployment
5. Deploy Application Only - When ArgoCD is already installed
6. Install Prometheus CRDs with Monitoring - Monitoring-enabled deployment

### Documentation
- Enhanced deployment script documentation
- Added tool installation instructions
- Documented validation process
- Included troubleshooting guide

## ðŸ§ª Testing
All validation tests pass:
- Python code validation âœ…
- Basic tests (3/3) âœ…
- Helm chart validation âœ…
- ArgoCD application validation âœ…
- Dockerfile validation âœ…
- requirements.txt validation âœ…

## ðŸ“Š Impact
- No performance impact on existing functionality
- Enhanced deployment reliability
