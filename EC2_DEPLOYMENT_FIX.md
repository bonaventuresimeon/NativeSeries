# 🔧 EC2 Deployment Fix

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**

The deployment was failing because **Docker Compose was not installed** on your EC2 instance. The error messages showed:

```
unknown shorthand flag: 'd' in -d
docker: 'compose' is not a docker command.
```

This happened because:
1. Docker was installed but Docker Compose was missing
2. The scripts were trying to use `docker compose` (plugin version) which wasn't available
3. The fallback `docker-compose` command also wasn't available

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

I've created multiple fixes to resolve this issue:

### **1. Updated Deployment Scripts**
- **`deploy.sh`** - Now automatically installs Docker Compose if missing
- **`docker-compose.sh`** - Now automatically installs Docker Compose if missing
- **`cleanup.sh`** - Updated to handle both `docker-compose` and `docker compose` commands

### **2. Created Quick Fix Scripts**
- **`quick-fix.sh`** - One-command fix for immediate deployment
- **`install-docker-compose.sh`** - Standalone Docker Compose installer

## 🚀 **How to Fix Your Deployment**

### **Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)**
```bash
# Run this on your EC2 instance
sudo ./quick-fix.sh
```

This will:
1. Install Docker Compose automatically
2. Deploy your application
3. Verify everything is working
4. Show you the access URLs

### **Option 2: Manual Fix**
```bash
# Step 1: Install Docker Compose
sudo ./install-docker-compose.sh

# Step 2: Deploy with updated script
sudo ./deploy.sh
```

### **Option 3: Manual Docker Compose Installation**
```bash
# Install Docker Compose manually
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

# Verify installation
docker-compose --version

# Deploy application
docker-compose up -d --build
```

## 🔍 **What Was Fixed**

### **1. Docker Compose Installation**
- Added automatic detection and installation of Docker Compose
- Supports both `docker-compose` and `docker compose` commands
- Handles different architectures (x86_64, aarch64, armv7)

### **2. Script Compatibility**
- Updated all scripts to work with both Docker Compose versions
- Added fallback mechanisms for different environments
- Improved error handling and user feedback

### **3. Deployment Process**
- Fixed the `-d` flag issue by using proper Docker Compose commands
- Added proper service verification
- Improved logging and status reporting

## 📋 **Updated Scripts**

| Script | Purpose | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `deploy.sh` | Complete deployment | ✅ Fixed |
| `docker-compose.sh` | Docker Compose only | ✅ Fixed |
| `cleanup.sh` | Cleanup resources | ✅ Fixed |
| `quick-fix.sh` | One-command fix | ✅ New |
| `install-docker-compose.sh` | Docker Compose installer | ✅ New |

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

After running the fix, you should see:
